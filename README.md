This program should be ran in MATLAB online. Once ran, the user will prompt to enter the starting x, starting y, target x, and target y positions in that order. Once entered the program will output the following:

Every 100ms the program will output a matrix of distance membership values, a velocity membership matrix, an angular velocity membership matrix, the output force, output angular velocity, distance to target, time, and angle offset which is the difference between the target angle and the angle the robot is facing. These will be output until the robot is less than 1/8 the starting distance. Plots of membership functions made based on your input will also be output.
